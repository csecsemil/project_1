In the project, I made a burger-building game, where you have to stack ingredients in the right order based on a randomly given recipe. I set up each ingredient to have a price, the player has a certain amount of money, and if they make a mistake or start over, they get a penalty. I also made a timer, a floating money animation, and several visual feedbacks to make the game more enjoyable.
